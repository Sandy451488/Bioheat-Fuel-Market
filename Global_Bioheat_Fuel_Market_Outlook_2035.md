## Market Dynamics: Decarbonization Goals Fueling Demand

### Key Drivers

1. **Biodiesel Blending Mandates**  
   Several U.S. states—including **New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island**—now enforce blending requirements for heating oil, compelling suppliers to offer blends like **B5, B20**, or **B50**. These mandates help reduce carbon intensity while boosting demand for biodiesel.

2. **Ease of Integration**  
   One of the strongest appeals of bioheat fuel is its **compatibility with existing oil-fired furnaces and boilers**, requiring no significant equipment modifications. This reduces the entry barrier for homeowners and businesses looking for a cost-effective sustainability solution.

3. **Incentives and Rebates**  
   **Government tax credits and grants** are increasing adoption, especially in the residential sector. In New York, for example, B20 bioheat fuel users are eligible for a **20-cent-per-gallon state tax credit**, reducing operational costs while promoting greener energy.

4. **Feedstock Availability**  
   With biodiesel production becoming more scalable—thanks to feedstocks like **soybean oil, used cooking oil, and animal fats**—the cost and supply stability of bioheat fuels have improved, making them a **viable and affordable alternative**.
